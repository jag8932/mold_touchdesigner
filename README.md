Experimental code for how 'mold' positions would behave on touchdesigner. Ultimately this code was not implemented for Imagine RIT.
This code references Table DAT nodes and updates the position coordinates inside. Two different behaviors include a 'blobby' type mold and 
an attractor type mold. The attractor mold is in a constant state of free floating around the petri dish. The blobby mold chases after the attractor mold.
